## ⚠️ CORS

There's a little problem with CORS. You can bypass the problem by using the other URL in `src/api.rest-client.js:5` or using a CORS plugin in the browser you're testing.

## Includes

- Memoized for rest requests
- Lazy loading of images
- Control of list api endpoint unreachable
- Awesome design
- Opacity transition effects for smoother UX
- Support for Chrome and Chromium based browsers, Safari and Firefox.
- Responsive and `EM` based styles (not pixels) (change body's font-size to see the difference).

## Pending

- CSS Mobile Breackpoints
- Pagination Requests to the API
- Loading indicators for Detail and trailer video loading
- Explorer Edge support. (Not tested)

## Bundle Optimization

- Load dash.js separately.
- Load react engine separately.
